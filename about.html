    <div class="about">
        <p id="about">Having always been curious about coding, I became serious about programming a year ago, completing an online FreeCodeBootCamp course that provided me with a solid understanding of C++ and further ignited my interest in software development. In late 2024, I took the next step in my journey by enrolling in the JustIT Software Development Bootcamp to transition from a hobbyist to a professional developer.

    <p class="about2">With 5 years of experience in retail, I have developed excellent interpersonal and communication skills, enabling me to effectively understand and collaborate with clients. My combination of technical skills and customer-oriented experience positions me as a well-rounded candidate ready to excel in software development.</p>
